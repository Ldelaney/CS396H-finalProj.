Application Description Breakdown
This web application will have five main parts: the webpage, reading the syllabus and extracting data from it, building a new calendar from the extracted data, and giving that calendar to the user.  

The Webpage:
	Should display information about what it does
	Should prompt the user to choose what kind of calendar they want to be given
		Google calendar
		Printable calendar
	Should allow the user to upload their calendar

Reading the Syllabus
	Use visual basic to parse data, especially data from tables
	Consider trying to learn the basics of how wordâ€™s XML works
	GOAL: read the text, find numbers and symbols, find information in tables, without losing the implicit information based on the location of the text in a table. We need more than just plaintext. 

Extracting data
	Use AI methods to search for things that look like dates, and/or days of the week
	Try to pair the date with the information near it
		Things in the same row of the table
		Same sentence or same line?
	For each day that is found, build an event object for it to store the relevant information.
		Used to build the actual calendar
		Multiple events in one day?
		Finding times vs all day events?

Building the calendar
	Take each event built in the previous stage and either:
	1)	Fill in a printable calendar square
	2) Use the google calendars API (with user authentication) to build a google calendar of events for the class

Giving the calendar to the user
	Display a screen with the printable calendar OR
	Redirect the user to their google calendar page
